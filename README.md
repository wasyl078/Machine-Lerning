# :open_mouth: Machine Lerning
This is my collection of Machine Lerning related codes and algorithms.
For now there are two simple (but as I hope interestingly made) files.

LRWOV is Linear Regression With One Variable - my implementation of this problem. I have written this code as clearly as it was possible to check out.

MNK is Polynomial Regression With One Variable (without and also with regularization) - this is some kind of test: how will algorithm behave if we will remove 2 of 10 alements from the data set.

## Technologies 
For this moment I focus on creating all code in jupyter notebooks (Python 3.7) with numpy and matplotlib libraries. Some comments inside are written by using LaTeX.

## How to check my work
Everything is clearly visible in .ipynb files. I'm trying not to forget to write every necessary expression and formula there.

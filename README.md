# :open_mouth: Machine Lerning
This is my collection of Machine Lerning related codes and algorithms.
For now there are four simple (but as I hope interestingly made) files.

[Linear Regression With One Variable.ipynb](https://github.com/wasyl078/Machine-Lerning/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20With%20One%20Variable.ipynb "Linear Regression With One Variable.ipynb") - this is very simple implementation of this problem. I have written this code as clearly as it was possible to check out. The main quaint thing is that there are also some extra lines on the plot, which represent how the computer adjusts the regression line.

[Polynomial Regression With One Variable.ipynb](https://github.com/wasyl078/Machine-Lerning/blob/master/Polynomial%20Regression%20With%20One%20Variable.ipynb "Polynomial Regression With One Variable.ipynb") - I used Gradient Descent Method, it is not the fastes way to solve such equations, but it is an another example how You can suit your parameters to given data samples.

[MNK.ipynb](https://github.com/wasyl078/Machine-Lerning/blob/master/MNK.ipynb "MNK.ipynb") is also Polynomial Regression With One Variable. I also used regularization. In here You will find some kind of test: how will algorithm behave if we will remove 2 of 10 elements from the data set. I have used here Normal Equation - much faster method than Gradient Descent for this type of challange.

[Mutliclass Classification - kNN, NB, LR.ipynb](https://github.com/wasyl078/Machine-Lerning/blob/master/Mutliclass%20Classification%20-%20kNN%2C%20NB%2C%20LR.ipynb "Mutliclass Classification - kNN, NB, LR.ipynb") - 

## Technologies 
For now focus on writing down all code in jupyter notebooks (Python 3.7) with numpy and matplotlib libraries. Some comments inside are written by using LaTeX, just to have better view on what is going on there.

## How to check out my work
Everything is clearly visible in .ipynb files. If github doesn't want to display the code, refresh the site, multiple times.
